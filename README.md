## üß† About
The HBnB Evolution project is a simplified, modular AirBnB-like platform designed to manage properties, users, amenities, and reviews in a structured and scalable architecture. The goal of HBnB Evolution is to build a platform that allows users to manage rental properties, share reviews, and associate amenities with listed places. 

Users can register as guests or administrators, create and manage property listings, and provide feedback in the form of reviews. The application is structured to support CRUD operations for Users, Places, Amenities, and Reviews, while enforcing essential business rules such as ownership, relationships, and audit tracking.

This documentation covers:
A high-level overview of system architecture using a layered approach.
Detailed business logic design through class diagrams.
Interaction modeling through sequence diagrams for core API operations.
By clearly defining the responsibilities and interactions of each component, this documentation will guide the engineering team in implementing a maintainable and extendable system that aligns with clean architectural principles such as separation of concerns and single responsibility.





## üóÇÔ∏è High-Level Package Diagram
### Overview
The HBnB Evolution application is a structured around a three-layer architecture:

![Alt text](part1/img/HIghLevelArc.png)

Presentation Layer
Purpose: This is the interface between users and the system.

Business Logic Layer
Purpose: Central hub for application logic and domain rules.

Persistence Layer
Purpose: Abstracts all direct interactions with the database.


Communication between the layers leverages the: 
Facade Pattern (Presentation Layer and Business Logic Layer)
Database Operations (Business Logic and Persistence layers)





## üóÉÔ∏èBusiness Logic Layer

## üì¨ API Interaction Flow
The purpose of these diagrams is to illustrate how the API calls interact with different HBnB applications - Presentation, Business logic and Persistence layers. It helps to demonstrate how different components interact with each other to help with user requests and clarify responsibilities across the systems.

### üë§ User registration Diagram
This is to demonstrate how the end to end flow when a user signs up for an account.
![Alt text](part1/img/UserRegCreate.png)

#### Key components includes
* User - started the request
* UserRegistration - business logic for user registration
* API controller - it handles the HTTP request
* Database - store the user data

Design decisions and their rationale - it forms the base of user id and session management, and established the standard communication pattern for all the created operations.

### üìç Place Creation Diagram
This is to show how a login user creates a new property listing.
![Alt text](part1/img/propCreate.png)


#### Key components includes
* User - submits the property data
* API controller - it forward to the PropertyService
* PropertyService - check for user authorization and validity
* Database - data is saved and response is returned.

Design decisions and their rationale - it demonstrated how new resources are created.


### üëç Review Submission Diagram
This is to show how users can submit reviews for existing properties
![Alt text](part1/img/ReviewService.png)


#### Key components includes
* User - send review data with API
* API controller - Validates requests and checks if the property exists.
* ReviewService - the review object is created 
* Database - data is saved and a confirmation is returned to the user.

Design decisions and their rationale - it supports the feedback from users to the property listing. 


### üó∫Ô∏è Fetching a List of Places
This is to show the flow when the user requests a list of filtered available properties.

![Alt text](part1/img/PropSubmitReq.png)

#### Key components includes
* User - sends a search request to the API
* API controller - the controllers forwards the request to the PropertyService
* PropertyService - retrieved the matching properties from the database
* Database - the results are sent back to the user.


Design decisions and their rationale - the query-based interaction helps with the discoverability and user to find the correct properties efficiently. 

Summary for sequence diagrams
These diagrams help to clarify the relationship between three layers - Presentation, Business Logic and Persistence using Facade Pattern at the service layer. The different component has single responsibility and a defined role.
